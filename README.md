# CoRide - Cab Booking System

## Introduction

CoRide is a ride-sharing application developed as a college project to demonstrate the implementation of a full-stack booking system. The platform connects drivers with passengers traveling in the same direction, enabling cost-effective and eco-friendly transportation.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a ride-sharing application that:
- Allows users to register and create profiles
- Enables drivers to publish available rides with vehicle details
- Provides passengers with the ability to search and book rides
- Implements booking management with cancellation policies
- Ensures driver verification through licence validation

## Features

### User Management
- User registration with personal details
- Secure login authentication
- Profile management with licence information

### Ride Management
- Create rides with source, destination, and fare details
- Specify car information (brand, model, number plate)
